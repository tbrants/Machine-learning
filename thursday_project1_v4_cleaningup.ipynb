    "# 1) Tested methods with different parameters by hand and in cross validation. I want good accuracy mainly\n",
    "- **least_squares_GD:** the more iters the greater the rmse error, gamma should be around 1e-6, initial weights better if ones than zeros. F1 ~ 0.41 and A ~ 0.63 . Cross validation is consistent. rmse is in the order of 5e63. With large gammas (1e-5 and 20 maxiters) it breaks. Later i got better results with zeros. Mystery.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **least_squares_SGD:** for big gammas (0.1) and many iters (80) the SGD gives an invalid value for matmul, i dunno why. Accuracy, F1 and rmse change a lot depending on the run without changing the parameters, between 0.36 an 0.65 the accuracy is jumping, so doesnt look very reliable, you can really see it in the cross validation accuracy prints. rmse is in the order of 5e56\n",
    "\n",
    "- **least_squares:** very nice. Gives F1 ~ 0.57 and accuracy ~ 0.74 always, as can be seen in the cross validation prints. rmse is 0.82.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ridge_regression:** when the penalization is small you get higher values for F1 and accuracy~0.74 (lambda=0.01) but when they are bigger (lambda=1000), the results get a liiittle bit worse: accuracy around 0.69 and F1 also falls from 0.53 to 0.31. In this method rmse is very small, around 0.85. Same for cross validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **logistic_regression_gd:** gamma desnt do anthing interesting, neither does iters or the initial weights. F1~ 0.36 and acc~0.66. the rmse_lr is 4e4 *negative* btw. Sometimes there is a warning that \"there is an overflow in the sigmoid function\" but then you run it again and disappears. Cross validation has the same results approx. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **logistic_regression_reg:** the gamma doesnt do much, but lamda decreases the accuracy from 0.66 to 0.31 when going from lambda=0.1 to 100. initial weights dont do anything, or maxiters. F1 gets higher with higher lambdas, from 0.36 to 0.4. The rmse is positive 1e17. Cross-v says the same.\n"
